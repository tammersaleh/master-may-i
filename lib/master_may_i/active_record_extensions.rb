# I add authorization query methods to every ActiveRecord model (through
# ActiveRecord::Base).  Each model is given the following methods:
#
# === {MasterMayI::ActiveRecordExtensions::ClassMethods Class methods}:
#
# * +Model.creatable_by? user+ 
# * +Model.creatable?+ 
#
# === {MasterMayI::ActiveRecordExtensions::InstanceMethods Instance methods}:
#
# * +@model.readable_by? user+ 
# * +@model.readable?+
# * +@model.editable_by? user+ 
# * +@model.editable?+
# * +@model.destroyable_by? user+ 
# * +@model.destroyable?+
#
# == Usage
#
# Use these methods throughout your application to determine who can do what.
#
#   link_to_if @note.editable?, "edit note", edit_note_url
#
# === Customization
#
# Each of the +creatable_by?+, +readable_by?+, +editable_by?+ and
# +destroyable_by?+ methods return true by default, and should be redefined by
# each model in turn.
#
# === Example
#
#   class Note < ActiveRecord::Base
#     records_creating_user :as => :owner
#
#     def self.creatable_by?(user)
#       user
#     end
#
#     def editable_by?(user)
#       return false unless user
#       user.administrator? or created_by?(user)
#     end
#   end
#
#   @note = Note.create               # Inside the controller
#   @note.owner                       => User record set via Authlogic session
#   @note.editable_by?(@note.owner)   => true
#   @note.editable_by?(nil)           => false
#   @note.editable_by?(other_user)    => false
#   @note.destroyable_by?(other_user) => true # ...since that's the default
#
# Each of the +creatable?+, +readable?+, +editable?+ and +destroyable?+ methods simply
# delegate to the +xxx_by?+ methods, passing in the currently logged in user.
# The currently logged in user is returned by the
# {MasterMayI::ActiveRecordExtensions::ClassMethods#user_from_session
# +user_from_session+} method, which looks at the Authlogic UserSession model.
#
# === Do not override the creatable?, readable?, editable? or destroyable?  methods.  Redefine the creatable_by?, readable_by?, editable_by? and destroyable_by? methods instead.
